  I hate Peanut Butter and Jelly together but here goes:

  To construct this sandwich you will need:
  2 slices of white wonder bread
  1 jar Skippy Peanut Butter (do not use non-fat, ugh)
  1 jar Smuckers Grape Jelly
  small knife
  smooth clean surface, preferably a plate that fits two slices of bread
  garbage pail

  One: place both slices of bread on plate side by side
  Two: using knife, scoop approximately 2 tbls of Skippy and spread evenly over one side of white bread only, making sure to smooth out lumps and cover the bread slice entirely.
  Three: using same knife (some people may take offense at this buy I don't like jelly so I don't care) scoop approximately 2 tbls of Smuckers Grape Jelly and spread evenly over one side of the remaining slice of bread; be sure to spread out any lumps and cover the slice of bread entirely.
  Four: put down the knife
  Five: Before joining, make sure that the bread slices match, i.e. top of one bread slice matching top of the other bread slice so you have symmetry.   
  Six: Using one hand for each slice of bread, pick up each slice of bread with the peanut butter and jelly sides facing up, keeping the plain unspread part of the slice in your palm, and place the two slices together.
  Seven: If you don't have sticky fingers pat yourself on the back.
  Eight: Throw sandwich into garbage.
  Nine: Forget about the jelly and make the same sandwich using only peanut butter by following steps One through Seven and omitting the jelly. 
  Ten: Give to [me], mmmmmm.
