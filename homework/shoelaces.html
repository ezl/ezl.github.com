Make sure your shoes are laced up with one lace fit through each hole at the top of the shoe
Grab ahold of the the laces - one with each hand - and cross them into an x
Take the right lace and tuck it through the bottom of the x then pull both laces tight
take the right lace and fold it in half creating a loop. Hold the loop with your right hand at the bottom of the loop close to the shoe
use your other hand to wrap the other lace around the base of the loop from back to front - near your right hand
you will notice a little gap created by the 2 laces - under the loop near your right hand
grab the lace in your left hand in the center  and stick it through the gap and form a second loop - be careful not to pull the lace all the way through - you should have at least 4 inches of lace not pulled through.
hold one loop with each of your hands and pull until the bow is secure

Shoe Tying Instructions: 

1) Put on your shoe and orient your foot so that the toe is facing directly away from you.
2) Grab the left side shoelace with your left hand and the right side shoelace with your right hand.
3) Pull the shoelaces up and away from each other, this will be your starting position.
4) Pull both ends together so that they cross into an "X" in the middle of each length. 
5) Fold one length underneath the intersection of the "X" and pull the length through the hole.
6) Pull both lengths until the loop disappears and a knot is formed in the middle, against the top of the shoe.
7) Pick one side and create a loop that takes up one half of the shoelace length remaining.
8) Take the opposite side length and tie the shoelace around the bottom of the loop your formed. 
9) Slip the length that doesn't have the loop in the space above the first knot and slightly below the loop.  The space will be framed by the shoelace without the loop at its edge.
10) Pull on both lengths so that a second knot is formed with two loops on each edge.

begin by tying a knot
then on one end of the shoelace--make a bunny ear
and on the other end of the shoelace- make another bunny ear
take both bunny ears 
make an x with the bunny ears
and take one bunny ear and put it through the hole that is created and pull it out the other side of the hole.
then pull both bunny ears tight
you are done and have tied your shoes.

1. Pull the two laces straight out until there is no slack. The right lace to the right side and the left
lace to the left side.
2. Then cross the laces so that the right lace and left lace cross in the middle. The right lace should
be on top of the left lace when they cross.
3. Take the right lace and loop then under the lace crossing. Once under the and through the
crossing, pull the right lace to the right and the knot will form.
4. Hoop the left lace with your left hand and wrap the right lace around the hoops base.
5. Then pull the right lace tight and tuck remaining lace into the shoes.

How To Tie Your Shoelaces
o   Provided the shoe is laced from bottom to top, as high as you like to wear your shoes, you’ll pull each side of the shoelace from each corresponding pair of eyelets

o   Starting with the 2nd pair of eyelets, counting from the bottom, pull each side of the shoelace, as they’re coming out of the eyelets, so as to cinch the eyelets below or bring them closer to each other

o   Move to the pair of eyelets just above, and pull the slack of shoelace through the eyelets, so as to cinch the pair of eyelets below

o   Repeat this process until each pair of eyelets is pulled comfortably tight up the top of your foot

o   Once the shoe is cinched tight enough around your foot, and you’ve pulled the shoelace through the various sets eyelets to your liking, pull each side of the shoelace out the top-most pair of eyelets so the slack dangles down the side of the shoe

o   Pick up the ends of each side of the shoelace, bring them both to the center and top of the shoe, cross the left side behind the right, flip it over the right shoelace towards you, drop down and wrap around the back so each shoelace has been drawn a full 360 degrees around the other

o   The shoelace from the left side will now extend towards the right side, and vice versa

o   Pull each side of the shoelace out, cinching the overlap until it hits the center and top of the shoe

o   Extending each length of shoelace, put your finger under the middle of each length on your right and left side, and let the ends fall down (as if the lace has been bisected at the fulcrum and draped atop itself)

o   Pinching the fulcrum of each length, bring them together at the center and top of the shoe and once again, cross the left side under the right side and wrap around for a full 360 degrees

o   Now pull the pinched segment from your right back to your right side, and the pinched segment from your left back to the left side

o   In the act, the pinched segments will be bound by a knot, which creates in each folded length of shoelace the semblance of a “bow”

o   Pull each bow as far out of the knot as possible so the knot cinches as low to the top and center of your foot as possible, leaving no slack beneath the knot

o   Pull each bow tight, cinching the knot tight around the top/center of your foot

Tying your shoes.

Begin with:
- Begin with a pair Converse Chuck Taylor All Star High-Top Shoes (One for the
left foot, one for the right. These shoes should already be evenly laced and on
your feet.

1. Begin with the right foot. You will notice the ends of the shoelaces in the shoe
on either side of your foot. The end of the shoelace on the right side of your
foot will be “Lace 1”, the end of the shoelace on the left side of your foot will
be “Lace 2”
2. Grasp Lace 1 with your right hand. Grasp Lace 2 with your left hand. Pull on
the laces gently upwards until you feel the shoe is comfortably snug.
3. Drape Lace 1 across your foot to the left side so that it aligns with the top
grommet (closest to your ankle) of the left side of the shoe. Drape Lace 2
across your foot to the right side so that it aligns with the top grommet of the
right side of the shoe.
4. Let go of both laces. With your right hand, grasp Lace 2 and wrap it
underneath Lace one, making sure that the laces still align with their
respective top grommets.
5. Loop Lace 2 so the lace creates a loop that is 2.5 inches in diameter,
beginning at the base of the lace. Pinch together with your thumb and index
fingers on your right hand.
6. Using your left hand, loop Lace 1 so the lace creates a loop that is 2.5 inches
in diameter, beginning at the base of the lace. Pinch together with your
thumb and index fingers on your left hand.
7. Wrap the loop of Lace 2 around the loop of Lace 1 once in a clockwise
motion, so that the top of the loop (away from where you are pinching it) is
below the base of the loop.
8. Pull the tops of Lace 1 and Lace 2 away from the shoe and from each other,
until the resulting knot is tight, and let go of the laces.
9. Repeat steps 1-8 with your left foot.
